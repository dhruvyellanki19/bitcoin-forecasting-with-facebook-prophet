* Changepoints helped guide Prophet configuration

### Volatility Analysis

* 30-day rolling std showed clustered volatility
* Log returns used for stability

## Contextual Zoom-In Events

After carefully examining Bitcoin’s long-term price trend, seasonality charts, and volatility plots, I noticed repeated cycles of sharp surges, steep drops, and prolonged recovery phases. To better understand these shifts, I conducted further research into real-world financial events, regulatory decisions, and technological milestones that could explain these anomalies. Below is a breakdown of major turning points in the time series, each aligned with known historical events:

* *2013 Bull Run* — Bitcoin touches \$1,150
  Month: December 2013
  First major spike, driven by demand in Asia and increased media coverage.

* *2014 Mt. Gox Collapse* — Market-wide crash
  Month: February 2014
  The Mt. Gox exchange collapsed, triggering Bitcoin’s first bear market.

* *2017 ATH* — Bitcoin nears \$20,000
  Month: December 2017
  Fueled by the ICO boom and retail speculation.

* *2018 Crypto Winter* — Year-long decline
  Month: December 2018
  Driven by speculative excess correction and regulatory uncertainty.

* *COVID-19 Crash*
  Month: March 2020
  Global panic led to Bitcoin losing over 40% of its value in a single day.

* *2020 Halving* — Start of a new bull phase
  Month: May 2020
  Third halving reduced block rewards to 6.25 BTC, creating supply pressure.

* *2021 Bull Run — Twin Peaks*
  Months: April and November 2021
  Peaks driven by the Coinbase IPO and ETF anticipation.

* *FTX Collapse & Bear Market*
  Month: November 2022
  Major drop following the collapse of a top crypto exchange.

* *2024 Halving* — Bullish trend begins again
  Month: April 2024
  Fourth halving reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC, historically marking new growth phases.

After identifying these key inflection points through trend and volatility analysis, I conducted additional research into macroeconomic and market-specific events to better contextualize the anomalies. While modeling is yet to be implemented, this understanding offers valuable insights into how changepoint detection and seasonality components can be configured in Facebook Prophet. The relationship between observed historical spikes and external events provides a strong foundation for developing interpretable and realistic forecasting models in the next phase of the project.

## Modeling

###  *Data Preparation & Feature Engineering *

The modeling process begins with meticulous data preparation to ensure the time series data is clean, continuous, and properly structured for analysis.

- Dataset Range: Spanning from 2012 to 2025, this project combines long-term historical data with real-time data, capturing multiple Bitcoin market cycles, including bull runs, crashes, and recoveries.
- *Target Variable*: Bitcoin's closing price (y), which represents the daily final price and serves as the prediction target.
- *Datetime Handling*: The Prophet library requires a ds column representing dates. All datetime columns were standardized to meet this requirement.

*Feature Engineering through External Regressors*
To improve the model’s awareness of real-world events affecting price trends, several binary and numerical regressors were added:

| Regressor Name        | Purpose                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| doubling_flag       | Indicates historical price-doubling events that often precede increased volatility.               |
| volatility_flag     | Marks high volatility periods to help the model adjust predictions during unstable markets.       |
| etf_approval_flag   | Captures the effect of regulatory events such as ETF approvals, which historically impact prices. |
| exchange_crash_flag | Flags events like the FTX collapse to account for market-wide crashes.                            |
| rolling_volatility  | 30-day rolling mean of closing prices to provide short-term trend awareness.                      |

*Holidays Incorporated*
Bitcoin halving events were explicitly included as custom holidays, as these events historically trigger significant price shifts.

* Dates: 2012-11-28, 2016-07-09, 2020-05-11, 2024-04-20

---

###  *Prophet Model Configuration*

The Prophet model was carefully tuned to capture the non-linear and highly volatile nature of Bitcoin price movements.

- Growth Type: Set to **Linear*, as this allows the model to track general growth trends while relying on changepoints to capture sudden shifts.

* *Seasonality*:

  * *Yearly Seasonality*: Enabled to model yearly cycles observed in the crypto market.
  * *Weekly Seasonality*: Disabled after EDA confirmed weekly trends had minimal influence.
  * *Monthly Seasonality*: Manually added with a Fourier order of 5 to capture known monthly trends, especially price increases between January and April.
  * *Seasonality Mode*: Set to **Multiplicative* to handle the exponential growth patterns seen in Bitcoin.

* *Changepoint Detection*:

  * n_changepoints = 100 ensured that the model could capture sharp market movements, such as those during the COVID-19 crash and the FTX collapse.
  * changepoint_prior_scale = 1.0 provided a balance between model flexibility and overfitting prevention.

###  *Model Training Results*

| Metric | Training Set |
| ------ | ------------ |
| RMSE   | 1,736.53 USD |
| MAE    | 929.40 USD   |
| MAPE   | 43.58%       |

*Analysis of Training Performance*

* The model successfully captured historical Bitcoin trends, including both extended bull markets (2013, 2017, 2021) and harsh bear markets (2014, 2018, 2022).
* Although sharp, extreme spikes in price were slightly underpredicted (a common limitation in financial modeling), the overall trend and cyclic behavior were accurately reflected.
* Incorporating external regressors and holidays greatly improved the model’s interpretability, enabling more realistic and explainable predictions.

##  Forecasting

###  *Forecasting Configuration*

* *Forecast Horizon*: 365 days, providing one full year of future price predictions.
* *Test Period*: 2023 – 2025 was chosen to validate the model against recent volatile periods, including the 2024 halving event and post-pandemic economic fluctuations.

The Prophet model was used to generate forecasts along with upper and lower bounds, which quantify the uncertainty inherent in Bitcoin price predictions.

---

### *Forecasting Insights*

* The model successfully captured the broad direction of the market across both upward rallies and sharp corrections.
* Confidence intervals effectively highlighted uncertain periods, especially around historically volatile events such as regulatory announcements and macroeconomic turbulence.
* Despite the complexity and unpredictability of cryptocurrency markets, the model demonstrated its ability to forecast within an acceptable margin of error.

#  Evaluation

### *Evaluation Metrics (On Test Set)*

| Metric | Value         |
| ------ | ------------- |
| RMSE   | 13,424.78 USD |
| MAE    | 9,817.14 USD  |
| MAPE   | 16.96%        |

*In-Depth Evaluation Analysis*

* *RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)*: Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors. While high due to the large absolute values of Bitcoin, it is within an acceptable range for financial assets.
* *MAE (Mean Absolute Error)*: Provides a direct interpretation of the average prediction error in USD terms, demonstrating reasonably accurate predictions.
* *MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): A MAPE of **16.96%* is highly competitive for financial time series data and indicates that the model's forecasts were quite reliable even during volatile periods.

*Key Takeaways*

* Prediction accuracy was robust despite high market volatility in the test period.
* External regressors played a significant role in reducing prediction errors by allowing the model to adjust dynamically during impactful events.
* The model was most challenged during periods of unprecedented price surges, a limitation common to most time series forecasting models.
